<center><h3>James</h3></center>
<p>The story of jonathan james is a bit shocking.He began hacking at a young age, managing to hack into several commercial and government networks.James eventually hacked into NASA's network and downloaded enough source code (assets equaling $1.7 million at the time) to learn how the International Space Station worked. NASA had to shut down its network for three entire weeks while they investigated the breach, costing an additional $41,000.In 2007, several high-profile companies fell victim to numerous malicious network attacks. Even though James denied any involvement, he was suspected and investigated. In 2008, James committed suicide, believing he would be convicted of crimes he didn't commit.</p>

<p>Gary McKinnon, known as "Solo" on the internet, allegedly coordinated what would become the largest military computer hack of all time.Over a 13-month period from February 2001 to March 2002, McKinnon illegally accessed 97 computers belonging to the US Armed Forces and NASA.He claimed he was only searching for information on free energy suppression and UFO cover-ups, but according to US authorities, he deleted a number of critical files and rendered over 300 computers inoperable, resulting in over $700,000 in damages.After a series of appeals, the British Prime Minister at the time, Theresa May, blocked his extradition on the grounds that he was "seriously ill" and that extradition would be "incompatible with [his] human rights.</p>

<center><h3>Astra</h3></center>
<p>The hackers which we saw above were somehow, caught by the police, but in this whole list, astra is only hacker who have never been caught.Astra is the pseudonym of a Greek hacker who infiltrated the computers of the French aviation company Dassault Group and stole weapons technology data for over five years. The information he accessed included confidential data about jet fighters and other military-grade aircrafts.and when the forces tried to trace him, he escaped from there, and never been caught. Many people say that Astra was an Indian.</p>
